            "text_2": "<p>The core of the religion of Islam is the attestation to two phrases:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; line-height: 2.3'>(i)  <i>La ilaha illa Allah</i> (meaning ‘There is no god rightfully worshipped except Allah’) <p style='text-indent: 0%; line-height: 2.3'>(ii)  <i>Muhammad rasoolu Allah</i> (meaning ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah’)</p> <p>These two phrases are known as the Shahadah, or Testimony of Faith. Through the belief and attestation of these two phrases one enters the fold of Islam. It is the central belief that a believer maintains throughout his life, and is the basis for all his beliefs, worship and existence in this world.</p> <p>Every Muslim, including someone new to Islam, has to understand the meanings of these two phrases, and try to live his life accordingly.</p>", 
            "text_3": "<p>This Testimony is by far the most important aspect of the religion of Islam, upon which the whole religion is built. Islam is the only true monotheistic religion, stressing that no worship should be directed to any other except Allah. It is a way of life in which a person obeys and worships the orders of Allah and none else.</p> <p>This Testimony of Faith (Shahadah) reminds us of our purpose in life, which is the worship of Allah alone.  Allah says in the Quran:</p> <blockquote>“And I have not created neither jinn nor humans, except to worship Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)</blockquote> <p>The message of the Oneness of God (Tawheed) found in the Testimony was not particular to the message of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. It was the universal message of all Prophets of Allah. Since the dawn of humanity, Allah sent Messengers to every people and nation, commanding them to worship Him Alone, and to reject all false deities. Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“And indeed We have raised amongst every nation a Messenger, [commanding them] 'Worship Allah, and reject all false deities'.” (Quran 16:36)</blockquote>",
            "text_4": "<p style='line-height: 2.3'>The meaning of each word in the phrase is:</p> <p style='line-height: 2.3';'><i>La</i>: There is no; &nbsp<i>ilaha</i>: god (deity); &nbsp;<i>illa</i>: except; &nbsp;<i>Allah</i>: Allah (God)</p> <p style='line-height: 2.3'>And therefore the literal meaning of this phrase is “There is no god (deity) except Allah”</p> <p style='font-size: 1.8em; margin: 10px 0 15px 0; text-indent: 0%;'>First Part of this phrase: Rejection</p> <p>‘There is no god (deity)’… Here, god with a small case ‘g’ is anything which is worshipped. Many people have taken things in creation as their gods and deities, but they are all false and are wrongfully worshipped, meaning that they have no right to that worship, nor do they deserve it. This rejection extends to all superstitions, ideologies, ways of life, or any authority figures who claim divine devotion.</p> <p>Some people imagine the Divine Kingdom of God to be like earthly kingdoms. Just as a king has many ministers and trusted associates, they imagine ‘saints’ and minor deities to be our intercessors to God.  They take them as agents through whom God is approached. In truth, there are no intercessors in Islam, nor any class of clergy to whom one must ‘confess’ their sins to be forgiven. A Muslim prays directly and exclusively to God. We also reject superstitious practices such as astrology, palm reading, good luck charms, and fortune-telling.</p> <p style='font-size: 1.8em; margin: 15px 0 15px 0; text-indent: 0%;'>Second Part of this phrase: Affirmation</p> <p>‘Except Allah’… After denying the right of any created being to be worshipped, the Testimony affirms divinity for Allah alone, with ‘…except Allah.’</p> <p>Allah, in the Quran, mentions in many places that all things which people take as objects of worship besides Allah do not deserve any worship, nor do they have any right over it, as they themselves are creations and have no power to bring any benefit.</p> <blockquote>Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead” (Quran 25:3)</blockquote> <p>Thus, <i>la ilaha illa Allah</i> means, “There is no true god except Allah” or “There is no god rightfully worshipped except Allah.”",    
            "text_5": "<p style='line-height: 2.3'>The meaning of each word in the phrase is:</p><p style='line-height: 2.3'><i>Muhammad</i>: Prophet Muhammad; &nbsp;<i>rasoolu</i>: Messenger; &nbsp;<i>Allah</i>: Allah (God)</p> <p style='line-height: 2.3'>And therefore this phrase means, “Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”.</p> <p>By testifying to this fact, one affirms that Prophet Muhammad is in fact a Prophet and Messenger raised by God, amongst mankind to deliver the message of God, as were other Prophets and Messengers. Attesting to this fact implies a multitude of meanings. These include:</p><p>1.  To believe that he was the last Prophet and Messenger.</p> <blockquote>“Muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets and Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything” (Quran 33:40)</blockquote> <p>2.  To believe that he delivered the message of Allah faithfully just as he received it without any deficiency. Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“…This day, I have perfected your religion for you, and completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…” (Quran 5:3)</blockquote> <p>3.  To believe that he was a Prophet to all mankind. Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“Say: O humanity!  I am Allah’s Messenger to you all…” (Quran 7:158)</blockquote> <p>4.  To believe that everything he said about the religion was revealed from Allah. He is to be taken as an example and obeyed without reservation as he speaks in the Name of Allah and obeying him is obeying Allah.</p> <blockquote>“He does not speak from his own desire, it (his speech) is only a revelation inspired [to him]” (Quran 53:3-4)</blockquote> <blockquote>“He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah...” (Quran 4:80)</blockquote> <p>5.  We must worship Allah according to the law brought by him. He abolished all previous laws including the Mosaic Law.</p> <blockquote>“And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he shall be one of the losers.” (Quran 3:85)</blockquote> <p>6.  Prophet Muhammad is to be loved and honoured.  Knowing about his morals, his sacrifices for spreading monotheism, and patience with his opponents all increase one’s appreciation of him.  The more we learn about his life and characteristics, the more we will increase in our love for him.<p> <p>In summary, the testimony <i>Muhammad rasoolu Allah</i> means obeying Prophet Muhmmad in what he commands, believing him in what he informs, shunning what he has prohibited, and worshipping Allah alone the way he instructed us.  These matters are not restricted to a certain people or to a specific time.</p>"

Umar, one of the closest of companions to the Prophet, related the following occurrence:</p><p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“Once, while we were sitting with the Prophet, a man appeared before us whose clothes were exceedingly white and hair exceedingly black.  No signs of traveling were seen on him and no one among us knew him.  He sat towards the Prophet, resting his knees against his knees and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs. He then said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>The Messenger replied: ‘Islam is to testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the compulsory charity (<i>zakah</i>), to fast in <i>Ramadan</i>, and to make the pilgrimage to the House if you are able to do so.’<p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>He said: ‘You have spoken the truth.’</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>We were amazed at him asking questions and then saying he had spoken the truth!</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>He then inquired: ‘Tell me about faith (<i>Imaan</i>)?’</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>The Prophet replied: ‘It is to believe in Allah, His angels, His scriptures, His messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its sweetness and its bitterness.’</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>He said: ‘You have spoken the truth.’</p> <p>Umar then related some more questions he asked and the answers given by the Prophet.  Finally, when the man left, the Prophet asked:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>‘O ‘Umar, do you know who was the questioner?’</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>I said: ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>The Prophet said: ‘It was Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.’”</p>",
            "text_2": "<p>The Arabic word <i style='font-weight: bold'>‘Islam’</i> means to submit, a total surrender, a total resignation to God.  Therefore, a ‘Muslim’ is ‘one who submits to God.’ Islam means to submit to Allah alone, to worship and serve Allah alone, and to believe and follow the prophet sent to them.  To many non-Muslims, ‘Islam’ is a religion that began in the seventh century in the Middle East, but to Muslims, Islam has always been the only religion of Allah since the time of Adam, the first man.  Thus, Islam was the religion of all prophets who came after him.  In the time of Moses, Islam was to worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings Moses had brought, and Islam in the time of Jesus was to worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings Jesus had brought, as they were both prophets sent by God to teach his religion.  After the coming of Prophet Muhammad, Islam is to worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. Although the teachings of all the prophets about God, the Afterlife, and all other realities of belief were the same, there were slight differences in the methods of practice, worship and service, for each prophet was sent to a specific nation and specific period of time. Even though previous religions come under the general heading of Islam, the religion of Muhammad has specifically been given the name ‘Islam’ by God, as it is the final religion prescribed for humanity until the Day of Judgment.</p>",

What is the Quran and how is it organized?  What are its major themes and its style of presentation?  What are some good translations for a beginner, and what must we keep in mind when reading them?  Can the Quran be interpreted freely according to one’s heart?</p>",
            "text_2": "<p>The Quran is the literal, spoken Word of Allah revealed to the last Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, through Gabriel, the Angel of Revelation, transmitted to us by numerous channels, both verbally and in written form.  Inimitable and unique, it is divinely protected from corruption. God says:</p> <blockquote>‘Indeed, it is We who sent down the message [i.e., the Qur'an] and indeed, We will be its guardian.’ (Quran 15:9)</blockquote>",
            "text_3": "<p>The first thing for a beginner to understand about the Quran is its form.  The Arabic word, ‘Quran,’ literally means both ‘recitation’ and ‘reading’. Similarly, the Quran was both recited orally and written down in book form.  The true power of the Quran remains in the oral recitation, as it is meant to be read aloud and melodiously, but still the verses were written down on available materials as an aid to memorizing and guarding it, and these were collected and arranged in book form both privately and, at a later stage, institutionally. The Quran was not meant to tell a chronological story, and thus, the Quran should not be viewed as a sequential narrative like the book of Genesis.</p> <p style='margin-bottom: 30px'>The Quran often repeats certain verses and themes, shifting topics between them, and often relates narratives in summarized form.  We can see two reasons for this.  First, it serves a linguistic purpose and is one of the powerful rhetorical techniques of classical Arabic.  Second, all themes of the Quran, no matter how varied, are wrapped around one common thread running through the entire book: there is no true god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.  The Quran, unlike the Bible, is not concerned with genealogies, chronological events, or minute historical details, many of which don’t suit an oral discourse.  The purpose is to use events, from past and present, to illustrate this central message.  So when the Quran is discussing the healing properties of honey or the life of Jesus, neither topic is an end in itself, but each is related in one way or another to the central message – the Oneness of God and unity of the prophetic message.</p> <p>Another important point to keep in mind is that the Quran was not revealed in one sitting, but rather it was revealed in parts over a span of 23 years.  Many passages were in response to specific events.  Often, Quranic revelation would come from the angel Gabriel to Prophet Muhammad as a response to questions raised by unbelievers.  The Quran addresses these unbelievers, the People of the Scripture (a term used by the Quran for Jews and Christians), humanity at large, believers, and, finally, the Prophet himself - commanding him what to do in a certain situation or solacing him in the face of ridicule and rejection.  Knowing the historical and social context of revelation clarifies the meanings contained in the text itself.</p>",
            "text_4": "<p>The Quran is composed of 114 parts or chapters of unequal length.  Each chapter is called a <i>surah</i> in Arabic and each sentence or phrase of the Quran is called an <i>ayah</i>, literally ‘a sign.’ Like the Bible, the Quran is divided into discrete units, referred to as ‘verses’ in English. These verses are not standard in length and where each begins and ends was not decided by human beings, but dictated by God.  Each one is a discrete act of locution of closed signification, or ‘sign’, denoted by the word <i>ayah</i> in Arabic.  All <i>surahs</i>, except one, begin with <i>Bimillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim</i>, ‘I begin with the Name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Compassionate.’ Each <i>surah</i> has a name that usually relates to a central theme within it.  For example, the longest <i>surah</i>, <i>Surah</i> al-Baqarah, or “The Cow”, is named after the story of Moses commanding the Jews to offer a sacrifice of a cow, which begins by God saying:</p> <blockquote>“And remember Moses said to his people: ‘Allah commands that you sacrifice a cow.’” (Quran 2:67)</blockquote> <p>Since the various chapters are of various lengths, the Quran was divided by scholars of the first century after the death of the Prophet into thirty roughly equal parts, each part is called a <i>juz’</i> in Arabic. This division of the Quran was done in order for people to memorize or read it in a more organized fashion, and it has no influence on the original structure, as they are mere marks on the sides of the pages denoting the part.  In the month of fasting, <i>Ramadan</i>, one <i>juz’</i> is usually recited every night, and the entire Quran is completed by the end of the month.</p>",
            "text_5": "<p>What topics does the Quran discuss?  It covers various subjects.  Most importantly, it talks about the Oneness of Allah and how to live a life pleasing to Him.  Other topics include religious doctrine, creation, criminal and civil law, Judaism, Christianity and polytheism, social values, morality, history, stories of past prophets, and science.  The most important features of Quran’s style in discussing these themes are:</p> <ol class='custom-marker parens-around lower-roman'><li>The use of parables to stir curiosity of the reader and explain deep truths.</li> <li>More than two hundred passages begin with the Arabic word <i>Qul</i> - ‘Say’ - addressing Prophet Muhammad to say what follows in reply to a question, to explain a matter of faith, or to announce a legal ruling.  For example: <blockquote style='font-size: 21.92px;'>“Say: ‘O People of the Scripture!  Do you disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and the revelation that has come to us and that which came before (us), and because most of you are rebellious and disobedient?’”  (Quran 5:59)</blockquote></li> <li>In some passages of the Quran, Allah takes oaths by His marvelous creation, both to strengthen an argument or to dispel doubts in the mind of the listener: <blockquote style='font-size: 21.92px;'>“By the sun and its brightness,<br>By the moon when it follows it,<br>By the day when it displays it,<br>By the night when it covers it,<br>By the sky and He who constructed it,<br>By the earth and He who spread it,<br>By the soul and He who proportioned it…” (Quran 91:1-7)</blockquote> <br>Sometimes Allah takes an oath by Himself: <blockquote style='font-size: 21.92px;'>“But no, by your Lord, they will not (truly) believe until they make you, (O Muhammad), judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves, and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in (full, willing) submission.” (Quran 4:65)</blockquote></li> <li>Lastly, the Quran has what is called ‘the disjointed letters,’ composed of letters of the Arabic alphabet which, if taken together, do not have a known meaning in the Arabic lexicon. This was one of the ways that Allah challenged the Arabs, who were the most eloquent of people in speech, to bring forth something to the Quran, which consisted of the likes of these disjointed letters. They appear at the beginning of twenty-nine <i>surahs</i>.  For example, the first <i>aayah</i> of <i>Surah</i> al-Baqarah appears in different translations as: <p style='font-size: 21.92px; line-height: 2.3; margin-top: 30px; text-indent: 0%;'>Yusuf Ali: A.L.M. <br>Pickthal: Alif. Lam. Mim. <br>Muhsin Khan: Alif-Lam-Mim.</p></li></ol>"

            "text_2": "<p>A beginner should know a few points about Quran translations.</p> <p>First, there is a distinction between the Quran and its translation.  In Christian view, the Bible is Bible, no matter what language it may be in.  But a translation of the Quran is not the word of Allah, for the Quran is the exact Arabic words spoken by God, revealed to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, through Gabriel.  The word of God is only the Arabic Quran as Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“Indeed, I revealed it as an Arabic Quran.” (Quran 12:2)</blockquote> <p>A translation is simply an explanation of the meanings of the Quran.  The translated text loses the inimitable quality of the original so be aware of the degree to which a translation reflects the original message at every level of meaning, and that it will probably not match it.  For this reason, all which is regarded as recitation of the Quran is to be done in Arabic, such as the recitation of the Quran in salah.</p> <p>Second, there is no perfect translation of the Quran and being human works, each almost always has errors.  Some translations are better in their linguistic quality, while others are noted for their exactness in portraying the meaning.  Many inaccurate, and sometimes misleading, translations that are generally not accepted as reliable renditions of the Quran by mainstream Muslims are sold in the market.</p> <p>Third, while a review of all the English translations is out of the scope of this lesson, some translations are recommended over others.  The most widely read English translation is by Abdullah Yusuf ‘Ali, followed by that of Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall, the first translation by an English Muslim.  Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation is generally acceptable, but his footnote commentary, useful at times, can be odd and unacceptable.  Pickthall, on the other hand, has no footnotes or commentary and that makes it difficult for a beginner.  The language of both tends to be archaic and difficult to understand for some people.  Another widespread translation is done by Dr. Hilali and Muhsin Khan called ‘Interpretation of the Meaning of The Noble Quran.’ Although it is the most accurate, the many transliterated Arabic terms and endless parentheses makes it hard to follow and confusing for a beginner.  A newer version with more flowing text has been published by Saheeh International, and this is probably the best translation yet, as it combines both exactness in translation and readability.</p>",
            "text_3": "<p>Although the meanings of the Quran are easy and clear to understand, one must be careful to make assertions about the religion without relying on an authentic commentary.  Not only did Prophet Muhammad bring the Quran, he also explained it to his companions, and these sayings have been collected and preserved till this day.  Allah, the Exalted, says:</p> <blockquote>“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the message that you may explain clearly to men what is sent for them.” (Quran 16:44)</blockquote> <p>In order to understand some of the deeper meanings of the Quran, one should rely upon commentaries which mention these statements of the Prophet as well as his companions, and not upon what they understand from the text, as their understanding of it is limited to their prior knowledge.</p> <p>A specific methodology exists for exegesis of the Quran in order to extract the proper meaning. The Quranic sciences, as they are called, are an extremely specialized field of Islamic scholarship which requires mastery in multiple disciplines, like exegesis, recitations, script, inimitability, circumstances behind revelation, abrogation, Quranic grammar, unusual terms, jurisprudential rulings, and Arabic language and literature.  A person new to the exploration of Quran should approach it with humility.</p> <p>According to scholars of <i>tafseer</i>, the proper method of explaining the verses of Quran are:</p> <ol class='custom-marker parens-around lower-roman'><li><i>Tafseer</i> of the Quran by Quran.</li> <li><i>Tafseer</i> of the Quran by the Sunnah of the Prophet.</li> <li><i>Tafseer</i> of the Quran by the statements of the Companions.</li> <li><i>Tafseer</i> of the Quran by Arabic language.</li> <li><i>Tafseer</i> of the Quran by scholarly opinion if it does not contradict the above four sources.</li></ol> <p>A final word of advice to the beginner: keep notes, write down what questions arise during your reading, and finally turn to those who have proper knowledge about the religion and accept their explanation if it is based on evidence.</p>",

What makes us do the things we do?  What makes us happy?</p> <p>Many people will answer maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain is the ultimate key to human happiness.</p> <p>If so, how come people can be happy while in pain and unhappy while experiencing pleasure?  If pleasure is not the only motivating force that drives us, what does?  What desires must we fulfill to live a happy life?</p> <p>For most of those who see happiness in the carnal, rather than the spiritual, it is pretty basic: desire to avoid pain and anxiety, desire to spend time with relatives, desire to eat, desire for sexual gratification, desire for companionship, and desire for recognition to name a few.</p> <p>Life for such can be toilsome, provoking the plain query; what is it really aiming for?  In their quest for happiness, all too often people fall short of achieving any kind of inner peace.  We think that by always reaching higher and accomplishing more - more money, a better body, the perfect mate - we will automatically be happy.  That is an illusion.  People get caught up in chasing the materialistic dream under the illusion money can buy happiness until they discover the limits of materialism.  Impressing the neighbors and envy of possessions leaves us devoid of passion and depth in our lives, leading to the Modern Man’s Paradox:  Spiritual hunger in an age of plenty.</p>  <p>What is the paradox?  Simply put, it is this: As members of certain materialistic societies have grown richer, they have grown less content with their lives.  No society in the history of the world has ever enjoyed the standard of living known today in these societies: Incomes are up, prices are stable, unemployment is down, life expectancy is rising; they enjoy more freedom and opportunity than ever before.  Even their poor live well by world standards.  Yet in America, for example, since 1960, the divorce rate has doubled, teen suicide has tripled, violent crime has quadrupled, the prison population has quintupled, and some estimates put the incidence of depression in the year 2000 at ten times what it was in the year 1900.  Americans are less happy today than they were 40 years ago, despite the fact that they make 2.5 times as much money.  Our bellies may be filled, but we are left spiritually hungry.</p> <p>To find out what really drives human behavior, two kinds of happiness must be distinguished: feel-good happiness and value-based happiness.  Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure.  When we joke around or eat our favorite food, we experience feel-good happiness.  This type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time.</p> <p>Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives have meaning and fulfill the larger purpose of our existence by connecting us to Allah.  It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our deeper purpose and values.  Living a God-conscious life rooted in the values of the Quran and <i>Sunnah</i>, a Muslim is driven - beyond sensual pleasures - by the desire to make it to Paradise and to be safe from Hell after death.</p> <p>Islamic values that take a person towards Paradise and away from Hell are the most significant factors in motivating a Muslim’s behavior and in contributing to his or her sense of happiness. The desire to achieve Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all other desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on wealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of making it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of devotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on pleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One must remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.</p> <p>To be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams and realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!</p> <p>Ultimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate goal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers.  Paradise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of God, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence of pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is an abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel the least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally realized.</p>",
            "text_2": "<p><i>Jannah</i> (a beautiful garden) has historically inspired beauty, something which can be clearly seen in the beautiful gardens which were present throughout the Muslim world, such as those in Persia, Spain, and India, typically designed as a sort of escape or peaceful seclusion from the outside world.  Waterworks and fountains were a common inclusion in Muslim gardens for their free flowing beauty and soothing sound.  Artificial decorative elements were used in Muslim gardens as well, including the making of carpet-like parterres, and artificial trees and flowers made of precious metals and gemstones.</p> <p>For generations of Muslims, these gardens represented a kind of sacred art, the aim of which was to draw the visitor closer to God. Today, the Muslim gardens on earth are like shadows of the true Paradise.  These gardens serve as reminders to mankind of the heavenly abode to which the righteous will return.</p> <p>Shade is provided by canopies and pavilions.  Emphasis is placed on creating a space that indulges all the senses.  Fragrance is a common feature of Muslim gardens, and herbs were potted up to fulfill this role.  The decking provides a space for teaching and relaxing.  Muslim gardens never contain statues, carved stone fountains with figures, or representational sculptures.  Islam does not allow the use of such images.  Some Muslim gardens are so famed for their beauty that people come from far and wide to enjoy their tranquility.  Among them are the Alhambra Palace garden in Granada, Spain, the Jag Mandir Palace garden in India and the Major Elle residence garden in Marrakech, Morocco.</p> <p>The lush gardens created by Muslims are man-made inspirations for an earthly Paradise.  A secret haven secluded from the outside world; a place of tranquility, meditation, reflection, and prayer.  A modest prelude for what it is to come for believers in the Hereafter.</p>",
            "text_3": "<p>Those who enter Paradise will do so in their most perfect, beautiful form.  Their hearts will be one.  They will neither spit, nor blow their noses, or defecate.  They will remain young forever, strong and potent without the inconveniences of body hair.</p> <p>The worldly pleasures pretty much fade in the face of heavenly delights.  The pleasures of this world are fleeting and short-lived, for ‘…short is the enjoyment of this world,’ whereas the joys of Paradise will be unending, as ‘…the provision is eternal.’</p> <p>The fine clothes, delicious foods, soothing drinks, ornate jewels, and grand palaces in Paradise are far superior to what is in this world.  The ‘real estate’ of Paradise is described by the Prophet to be better than the whole world!</p> <p>Paradise is free of any pollutants, foul odors, pain, or discomfort.  The hearts and speech will be pure.  No one will be offended or insulted.</p> <p>The delicious, ripe fruits of Paradise will be within easy reach, ready for its residents to pick whatever fruit one desires.  Any food or drink will be available on demand.  Paradise has seas of water, wine, milk, and honey from which rivers will flow out.  You simply take your pick!  It has fountains scented with camphor and ginger, and shady valleys.  The wine will not cause hangovers.  It is “delight for those who drink”, bringing neither drunkenness nor rousing folly or quarrelling.</p> <P>The inhabitants of Paradise will be served in gold and silver goblets and dishes.  Their finest silk clothes will be decorated with gold, silver, and pearls…better than any man-made garment!  The scent of Musk will emanate from their bodies..  Their palaces will distinguished by refined elegance and be fully furnished.  They will be able to sit and recline in their gardens.  The beautiful bright colored couches will be lined with silk brocade.  Eye catching cushions and splendid carpets will add style and luxury.  A cozy place most people can simply dream of in this world, and  tranquil spot away from distractions;  peaceful, comfortable, and richly decorated.</p> <p>The faithful, who ‘will be served by immortal youths, with cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine;’ exquisite banquets served in priceless vessels.</p> <p>The faithful will visit one another and reunite with family and friends who made it to Paradise.  All wishes will be fulfilled, some in the strangest ways.  The Messenger of Allah said:</p> <blockquote>“If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant.” (Al-Tirmidhi)</blockquote> <p>Naturally, running after worldly pleasures at the cost of heavenly delights will be a cause of much sorrow for people who will enter Hell.</p>",

Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through the mirror of creation.</p> <p>In Paradise, no creature will stand between Allah and the faithful who will delight in His glimpse.  The most wonderful melody of all will be the voice of Allah greeting the select.</p> <p>Since in beholding Allah face to face the faithful will find perfect happiness and ultimate delight, the vision may be called “beatific”.  The joy of looking at Him will be greater than any other joy of Paradise, the rivers, palaces, tents of pearl, the pure spouses or the food and drink.  All other joys will pale in comparison to the joy of looking at the most beautiful Face of Allah.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote>“Some faces that Day shall be radiant looking at their Lord.” (Quran 75:22-23)</blockquote> <p>So the faces of the faithful will also radiate and become beautiful with His Light.</p> <p>The Prophet said:</p> <p>“When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allah will say, ‘Do you want anything more?’  They will say, ‘Have You not brightened our faces, admitted us to Paradise and saved us from Hell?’  Then the veil will be lifted and they will not have seen anything more dear to them than looking upon their Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.  This is what is meant by ‘even more.’”  Then he recited the verse:</p> <blockquote>“For those who have done good is the best reward and even more (i.e. having the honor of glancing at the Countenance of Allah)” (Quran 10:26)</blockquote> <p>Once you know that the people of Paradise will not be given anything dearer than looking upon the Face of their Lord, imagine the deprivation of the sinners described by Allah:</p> <blockquote>“Nay!  Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day” (Quran 83:15)</blockquote> <p>People said: “O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?”  The Messenger of Allah, may Allah praise him, said: “Do you doubt that you see the moon on the night when it is full?”  They said, “No, O Messenger of Allah.”  He said, ‘Do you doubt that you see the sun when there is no cloud?”  They said, “No, O Messenger of Allah.”  He said, “You will see Him likewise…”</p> <p>Let us pray to Allah to keep us steadfast in this life and to grant us Paradise from His mercy in the life to come and to grant us His vision.</p>",
            "text_5": "<p>Just as some people can’t perceive colors, so we may be soul-blind and soul-deaf.  The soul’s yearnings simply don’t get through to consciousness; or if they do, we try to numb ourselves to them with medications or frenzied activities.  The resulting alienation within our very hearts bears its own loneliness.  The soul wants to be attached and involved, because it is through such intimacy that it is nourished, initiated, and deepened.  The faithful will enjoy earthly and heavenly spouses in Paradise to satisfy the soul’s cravings for companionship and intimacy.  All the urgencies of the soul – the feeling of longing, the ache of desire for a beautiful, compatible partner, and the urgency to visit old friends – will be met.  The select will rejoice in the company of the parents, spouses and children who were believers.</p> <p>The faithful will be clothed in the richest silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, and pillows. In order to enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty, and vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise “aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most able to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and strength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose their youth.”</p> <p>The faithful will enter Paradise in the best and most perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their eternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.</p> <p>The faithful will enjoy specially crafted maidens, or <i>houris</i>, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of mortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects, and inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public view in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of gratification.</p>"

            "text_2": "<p>The inevitability of death is seldom thought about by the average person, whereas our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) informed us to remember and ponder about death often:</p> <img style=' margin: 0 auto 0 auto; display: block;' src='https://www.mymasjid.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Remember-often-the-destroyer-of-pleasures-muhammad.png'> <p style='margin-top: 30px;'>Death is an inevitable end for any human being. The Quran mentions this point in many verses.</p> <blockquote>“O you who believe! Do not let your wealth or children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that is lost. Give from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you and he says, ‘O Lord, if only you would give me a little more time so that I can give charity and be one of the righteous.’ Allah will not give anyone more time, once their time has come. Allah is aware of everything you do.” (Quran 63:9-11)</blockquote> <p>And in another verse the Quran reminds us that death will surely come and to prepare for it:</p> <blockquote>“Everyone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing).” (Quran, 3:185)</blockquote>",
            "text_3": "<p>To get an understanding of what this period of the journey to the Afterlife is like, we will share a story from one of the Companions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), his friend Uthman.</p> <p>One day a story was narrated by Uthman’s freed slave Hani.</p> <p>Hani narrates that when Uthman would stand in front of a grave he would cry until his beard would become moist.</p> <p>It was once said to Uthman; “You mention Heaven and Hell and you don’t cry yet you cry from this (i.e. the grave)?”</p> <p>Uthman replied; “Allah’s Messenger said: ‘Verily the grave is the first hurdle from the hurdles of the Hereafter (the next life). If one succeeds in it, then what is to come after it will be easier for him. However, if does not succeed in it, then what is to come after it will be harder for him.’”</p> <p>Muslims believe that when a person is buried in their grave, two angels will pay them a visit and ask 3 important questions:<br>“Who is your Lord <br>What is your religion? <br>Who is this man who was sent among you? “</p> <img style=' margin: 0 auto 0 auto; display: block; width: 50%' src='https://www.mymasjid.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/who-is-your-lord-1.jpg'> <p style='margin-top: 30px;'>The good soul will able to answer each question respectively; “Allah, Islam, and Muhammad.” Whereas the evil soul, although they may have known these answers in this life, will not be able to respond to these questions and will instead say: “Oh, oh, I do not know”.</p> <p>It is after the questioning of the angels that a life of either blessings or torment will begin for the soul. The good soul will have a life of goodness for eternity in Heaven. As for the evil soul, it will have an eternal life in Hell. What determines whether a person will end up in Hell or Heaven is based on two things: their beliefs and their deeds. Muslims believe that if a person believes in Islam and performs more good deeds than sins, then they will have a good ending in the afterlife.</p>",
            "text_4": "<p>The Day of Judgement is called by many names in Islam such as the Day of Recompense, the Day of Rising, and the Hour.</p> <p>The Hour is one of the many pieces of knowledge which no one besides Allah possesses.

Perhaps the Hour is near.’ Quran, 33:63)</blockquote> <p>We will discuss the many scenes that will happen on the day of reckoning through the Book of Allah (Exalted and High) and the sayings of our Noble Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p> <img style='margin: 0 auto 0 auto; display: block; width: 40%;' src='https://www.mymasjid.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/on-the-day-of-judgement-1-1.png'> <p style='margin-top: 30px;'>Allah will order one of His Angels, Israfeel, to blow a special horn and at that moment everything in existence will come to an end. Allah painted vivid pictures in the Noble Quran of this day in a number of verses.</p> <blockquote>And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will blown a second time and behold, they will be standing, looking on (waiting). (Quran, 39:68)</blockquote> <p>When the Hour comes every human being will only think about themselves. For example, mothers will forget about their children, brothers and sisters will forget about their siblings, and friends will forget about their closest companions. Every human will only worry about their own salvation because of the terrors of the Day of Judgement.</p> <p>All of mankind from the first generation to the last generation will all be gathered on a great plain. The sun will be brought much closer and everyone will be sweating except those whom Allah grants His Shade. This great day will feel like fifty thousand years according to the words of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The hearts of man will be in terror, not knowing what the outcome will be. And soon thereafter the judgement will begin. Everyone’s deeds will be accounted for and judged by Allah.</p> <blockquote>On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. And Allah warns you against Himself (His Punishment) and Allah is Kind to (His) servants. (Quran, 3:30)</blockquote> <p>After the judgment is complete there will be a party of people admitted into Paradise and a party of people admitted into Hell. And then the eternal life begins.</p>",

Allah will admit the dwellers of the Hell into the Hell (May Allah protect us from that) and admits the dwellers of Paradise into Paradise (May Allah make us among them).</p> <p>The dwellers of Hell will have the worst imaginable punishment. Allah says:</p> <blockquote>So taste (of that which you have earned), and never will We increase you except in torment. (Quran, 78:30)</blockquote> <p>The dwellers of Paradise will be given every type of pleasure. Rivers of water, milk, wine and honey will flow under perfect gardens and golden mansions.

The quality of a sermon greatly differs depending on the speaker who might be a knowledgeable scholar of Islam or a lay person.

Afterwards, the <i>Imam</i> will lead the congregation in a short prayer of two <i>rakahs</i>. <i>Salat ul-Jumuah</i> (the sermon and the prayer), usually lasts for an hour or less.</p>",
            "text_2": "<p>The Friday prayer is compulsory and required from all Muslim <b>men</b>. This is based on the Quran in which Allah says,</p> <blockquote>“O you who believe, when the call to prayer (<i>Adhan</i>) is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade aside. That is better for you, if you did but know.” (Quran 62:9)</blockquote> <p>Prophet Muhammad has stated very clearly who is required to pray <i>Salat ul-Jumuah</i> and who is exempt:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“The Friday prayer in congregation is an obligatory duty on every Muslim except four: a slave, a woman, a child, and a sick person.”</p> <p>To be precise, Friday prayer is required from every Muslim male who has reached puberty. Others can attend it, but are not sinful if they don’t.</p> <p>Additionally, Prophet Muhammad has given a stern warning against missing the Friday prayers. He said,</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“People should stop missing Friday prayers otherwise Allah will put a seal on their hearts and thus they will be among the heedless.”</p> <p>A Muslim man who is sick or travelling may miss the Friday prayer. A Muslim woman is not required to pray the Friday prayer, but she is allowed to attend the prayers if she wants to. Most mosques have separate seating arrangements for women, but some may lack women’s area for praying the Friday prayer. Also, the women who decide not to attend the <i>Salat ul-Jumuah</i> should offer the regular <i>Dhuhr</i> prayer at home.</p>",
            "text_3": "<ol class='numbers'><li>The Friday prayer brings local Muslims together in one place on a fixed day, thereby increasing the bonds of brotherhood between Muslims.</li> <li>The purpose of the <i>khutbah</i> (sermon) is to educate the Muslims and serves as a weekly reminder about their duties to Allah and fellow human beings. It warns against sin and disobeying Allah, and encourages to be good and to obey Allah.</li> <li>The topics are varied and often update the Muslims on current affairs and as Muslim what should be their role.</li></ol>",
            "text_4": "<p>Friday is a virtuous day with many special qualities.</p> <ol class='numbers'><li>Prophet Muhammad said:</li> <p style='text-indent: 0%;'><b>“When it is a Friday, the angels stand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons coming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a ram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out (for the Friday prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the <i>Khutbah</i>.”</b></p> <p>This narration shows the reward of coming early to the Friday prayer. The earlier a person arrives, the greater his reward. The first arrival attains the reward of sacrificing a camel for Allah, but those who arrive later receive lesser rewards.</p> <li>He also said:</li> <p style='text-indent: 0%;'><b>“The best day on which the sun has ever risen is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted into Paradise, and on it he was expelled from it, and the Hour will not be established except on Friday.”</b></p> <p>The purpose of this narration is to tell us of the magnificent events that took place on Friday or will take place.</p></ol>",
            "text_5": "<ol class='numbers'><li><b>Wear Clean Clothes & Smell Good</b></li> <p>Prophet Muhammad said, <b>“Every Muslim should have a ritual bath on Friday and wear his best clothing, and if he has perfume, he should use it”</b></p> <img style='float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 40%;' src='https://www.newmuslims.com/upload/lessons/images/Friday_Prayer_part_2._001.jpg'><li><b>Send Blessings on the Prophet</b></li> <p>It is highly recommended to send peace and blessings on Prophet Muhammad on Fridays as the Prophet said, <b>“Invoke blessings on me, many times over, on Friday and the night (preceding it); for whoever does so, I will be a witness and intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.”</b></p> <p>This is done by simply saying and repeating the words, <b><i>“Allahumma sal-ly wa sal-lim ‘Ala Muhammad.”</b></i>  Repeating these simple words anytime during Friday brings great blessings as mentioned in the above report form Prophet Muhammad.</p> <li><b>Increase Supplication</b></li> <p>A Muslim should increase his supplication to Allah on Friday because there is a time on Friday when Allah responds and gives whatever good He is asked for. The Prophet said, <b>“There is an hour on Friday in which no Muslim asks during it except that Allah grants him whatever he asks for.”</b></p> <p>One can supplicate in any language he wants. The etiquettes of supplication have been covered in previous lessons.</p> <li><b>Arrive Early at the Mosque</b></li> <p>Prophet Muhammad said, <b>“Whoever takes a bath on Friday like the one taken to purify oneself from sexual impurity, then he leaves at the earliest time, then he is like the one who offers a camel; the one who comes after that is like one who offers a cow; the one who comes after that is like one who offers a horned ram; the one who comes after that is like one who offers a chicken; the one who comes after that is like one who offers an egg. When the <i>Imam</i> arrives, the angels are present to listen to the remembrance (meaning the <i>khutbah</i>).”</b></p> <p>If a person comes late, he should not step over people already sitting in rows, nor separate two people sitting together. He should also not move another person and take their place. A Muslim should not walk directly in front of a person praying.</p> <li><b>Sit Close to the <i>Imam</i></b></li> <p>A person must try to arrive early and sit close to the <i>Imam</i> delivering the sermon. Sitting closer to the <i>Imam</i> is better than sitting behind in the back rows or reclining next to a wall. If a new Muslim finds it hard to sit on the floor for half an hour or so, he may sit where ever he feels comfortable, but he should try to get accustomed to sitting closer to the <i>Imam</i>.</p> <li><b>Don’t Talk During the <i>Khutbah</i></b></li> <p>Also, a Muslim should pay attention to the sermon and not talk during it, even if it is delivered in Arabic. Talking during the Friday prayer is a serious matter. Prophet Muhammad said, <b>“If you say to your friend, ‘Be quiet,’ on Friday when the <i>Imam</i> is delivering the sermon, then you have uttered non-sense.”</b></p> <p>In another narration, the Prophet said, <b>“…whoever utters nonsense is considered as if he has not attended the Friday prayer!”</b></p> <li><b>Pray Two <i>Rakahs</i> For Entering the Mosque Before Sitting Down</b></li> <p>If you arrive to the mosque early, you should pray two <i>rakahs</i> before sitting down. If you arrive while the <i>Imam</i> is delivering the sermon, you should still pray them, but make it short. The Prophet said, “If anyone of you enters the mosque on Friday while the <i>Imam</i> is delivering the <i>khutbah</i>, let him perform two <i>rakahs</i> and be brief in doing so.”</p> <li><b>Don’t Buy or Sell Once the <i>Adhan</i> Has Been Called</b></li> <p>This prohibition is based on the Quran itself,</p> <blockquote>“... when the <i>Adhan</i> is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trading aside...” (Quran 62:9)</blockquote> <li>The Friday prayer which consists of two <i>rakahs</i> is performed after the sermon behind an <i>Imam</i>. Someone who misses it should pray four rakahs of regular <i>Dhuhr</i> prayer.</li> <li>You can pray two or four <i>rakahs</i> of <i>Sunnah</i> (recommended) prayer after the Friday prayer.</li</ol>"

It can be translated as supplication or prayer. It is a <b>form of worship</b> because Allah orders us to make <i>du’a</i> to Him:</p> <blockquote>“And your Lord says, ‘Make <i>du’a</i> to Me, and I will answer you!’” (Quran 40:60)</blockquote> <p>Since <i>du’a</i> is an act of worship, the way it is made, the procedure to be followed, and the manner to be observed when performing this worship must be from the Quran and <i>Sunnah</i>.</p> <p><i>Du’a</i> is closely related to one’s faith. One, it is an open declaration that you believe in Allah and Allah alone. Two, it makes you feel that you are not in control of your life, Allah is. This is why you are going to Him and begging Him for your needs. Three, it reminds you that Allah truly hears your <i>du’a</i> and will respond to it.</p> <p>Since <i>du’a</i> is an act of worship, making <i>du’a</i> to someone other than Allah is an act of <i>Shirk</i>. </i>Du’a</i> can only be directed to Allah and Allah alone. One verse from the Quran is sufficient to illustrate this point:</p> <blockquote>“Say (O Muhammad), ‘I make <i>du’a</i> only to my Lord (Allah), and I associate none as partners along with Him.’” (Quran 72:20)</blockquote> <p>Suppose a person makes <i>du’a</i> to other than Allah, be it an idol or a saint, while believing that that being can hear him like Allah, and can answer his <i>du’a</i>, then doing so is equating that object or person with Allah. That is precisely <i>shirk</i>.</p>",

He is the Master of the physical world and Ruler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the Lord of every man, woman, and child.</p> <ol class='numbers'><li>Allah is the sole Lord and Ruler of the physical world.  The term ‘Lord’ here specifically means that He is the Creator, Controller; the Kingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs exclusively to Him, and He owns them.  He alone brought existence out of non-existence and all depend on Him for their conservation and continuance.  He did not create the universe and leave it to pursue its own course according to fixed laws and cease to take any further interest in it.  His power is required at every moment to sustain all creatures.  Creation has no Lord besides Him.</li> <blockquote>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth?  Or who owns hearing and sight?  And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living?  And who disposes the affairs?’  They will say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s punishment (for setting up rivals with Allah)?’” (Quran 10:31)</blockquote> <p>He is the ever-ruling King and the Savior, the Living God, full of wisdom.  No one can change His decisions.  Angels, prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant kingdoms are under His control.  Historically, few people have denied the existence of the Lord; throughout ages people for most part have believed in One God, a Supreme Being, a supernatural Creator.</li> <li>Allah is the only Ruler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver[1], the Absolute Judge, the Legislator, He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just like the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the moral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from wrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws, determine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human interaction and behavior.  His is the command:</p></ol> <blockquote>“His is the Creation and Command.” (Quran 7:54)</blockquote>",
        "text_4": "<p>Allah has the exclusive right to be worshipped inwardly and outwardly, by one’s actions and by one’s heart.  Not only can no one be worshipped apart from Him, absolutely no one else can be worshipped <i>along with</i> Him.  He has no partners or associates in worship.  Worship, in its comprehensive sense and in all its aspects, is for Him alone.</p> <blockquote>“There is no true god worthy of worship but He, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.” (Quran 2:163)</blockquote> <p>Allah’s right to be worshipped can not be over emphasized.  It is the essential meaning of <i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah</i>.  A non-Muslim enters Islam by testifying to Allah’s sole right to be worshipped.  It is the crux of Islamic belief in Allah, even all of Islam.  It was the central message of all prophets and messengers sent by Allah.  They all declared clearly:</p> <blockquote>“Worship Allah!  You have no other god but Him.” (Quran 7:59, 11: 50, 23:32)</blockquote> <p>It was the central message of Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Moses, the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all.  If Allah alone creates, gives life and death, provides food and security, gives hearing and sight, then He alone must be worshipped.</p> <p>Worship in Islam consists of every act, belief, statement, or sentiment of the heart Allah approves and loves, everything that brings a person closer to His Creator.  It includes everything Allah has legislated in the Quran or through His Prophet’s <i>Sunnah</i>.  It includes ‘external’ worship like the daily ritual prayers, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage as well as ‘internal’ worship such as faith in the six articles of faith, reverence, adoration, love, gratitude, and reliance.  An act of worship is not accepted unless it conforms to the following:</p> <ol class='numbers'><li>It is done exclusively for Allah and none should have any share in it, including one’s own self. Worship is not to be done even to satisfy the soul’s base desires, such as receiving praise or showing-off.  This is the meaning of <i>Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah</i>.</li> <li>It must conform with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. It must be performed in the exact manner performed by him, without any addition or omission.  This is the implication of <i>Muhammad Rasool-Allaah</i>.</li></ol> <p>Allah is entitled to all types of worship, the worship of the body, soul, and heart. It remains incomplete unless it is done out of reverence and fear of Allah, divine love and adoration, hope in divine reward, and extreme humility.  Giving anyone else - prophets, angels, Jesus, Mary, idols, or nature - a portion of worship due to Allah is called <i>Shirk</i> and is the most enormous sin in Islam.</p>",

Any name which one seeks to affirm for Allah must have been revealed in the Quran or <i>Sunnah</i>.</p> <p>The Names of Allah indicate His perfection and freedom from deficiencies.  Allah does not forget, sleep or get tired.  His seeing, like all other attributes, is not like human sight.  He is not unjust, and has no son, mother, father, brother, associate, or helper.  He was not begotten and He begets none.  He stands in need of none as He is perfect.  He does not become or resemble humans and has no need to do so to “understand” human suffering.

Islamically <i>riyaa</i> means to perform acts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than Allah.</li></ol> <p style='margin-top: 30px;'>The Arabic word <i>shirk</i> is the opposite of <i>tawheed</i>, Allah’s oneness, and is more inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.  It means associating Allah with other deities.  <i>Shirk</i> is to associate others with Allah in certain aspects designated as unique to Him and exclusively His in the Quran and <i>Sunnah</i>.</p> <p>There is no issue upon which Islam is so strict as the one of monotheism (<i>tawheed</i>). Associating partners with God (<i>shirk</i>) is the deadliest sin, the greatest violation with which the Lord of the heavens and the earth may be defied.  Death in the state of <i>shirk</i> permanently severs a person from divine grace:</p> <blockquote>“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner be set with Him (i.e.  the sin of <i>shirk</i>), and forgives all besides that to whom he pleases.” (Quran 4:48)</blockquote> <p><i>Shirk</i> has many forms, some of which will be discussed below.</p>",
        "text_2": "<p>Acts which fall under this category of <i>shirk</i> are regarded as unforgivable. Allah will not forgive them unless one repents.</p> <p style='text-idnent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“Verily, Allah does not forgive <i>shirk</i>, but He forgives other than that to whom He pleases”</p> <p>This category contradicts the very purpose of creation, as expressed in Allah’s statement:</p> <blockquote>“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)</blockquote> <p>In this category of <i>shirk</i>, acts of worship are directed to beings <i>other than</i> Allah or <i>alongside</i> Him, as is their rewards.  Allah gives an example of this type in the Quran, in His saying:</p> <blockquote>“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient to Him, but when he brings them safe to the land, lo, they commit <i>shirk</i> with Him.” (Quran 29:65)</blockquote> <p>The Quran stresses in many verses that Allah does not share His powers with any partner.  It warns those who believe their idols will intercede for them that they, together with the idols, will become fuel for Hellfire on the Day of Judgment.</p> <p>The greater <i>shirk</i> includes invoking or supplicating to a false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides Allah.  Christians pray to a man who they believe to share divinity with Allah, the Prophet of Allah Jesus, peace be upon him.  Catholics direct certain types of worship to saints, angels, and Mary, which they regard as “veneration”. All these things are regarded as <i>shirk</i>.</p> <p>It is also considered <i>shirk</i> to pray to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, or to graves of holy men.</p> <p>Believing in the legislation of others, whether governments or religious leaders in opposition to the clear teachings of Islam is also a major form of <i>shirk</i>, as Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)</blockquote> <p>They took them as lords besides Allah not by directly praying to them, but by willfully accepting their changing the lawful into prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave them the authority that only Allah has - to legislate in divine law.</p> <p>Another form of major <i>shirk</i> is giving any creation a portion of divine love reserved for Allah.</p> <blockquote>“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But those who believe love Allah (more than anything else)...” (Quran 2:165)</blockquote>",
        "text_3": "<p>Swearing by other than Allah and carrying out religious acts for worldly gain, like showing off or to win favors are two of the lesser forms of <i>shirk</i>.  Allah’s Messenger said:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold'>“The thing I fear for you the most is ‘lesser <i>shirk</i>.’ The companions asked ‘Oh!  Messenger of Allah, what is “lesser <i>shirk</i>?”  He replied showing off, for surely Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection when people are receiving their rewards, ‘Go to those for whom you were showing off in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.’” (</i>Ahmad, at-Tabarani, al-Baihaqi</i>)<p> <p>Once, the Prophet announced:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“O people, beware of hidden <i>shirk</i>!  The people asked, ‘O messenger of Allah, what is hidden <i>shirk</i>?’  He replied, ‘When a man gets up to pray and strives to beautify his prayer because people are looking at him; that is hidden <i>shirk</i>.’” (<i>Ibn Khuzaymah</i>)</p> <p>Showing off (<i>riyaa</i> in Arabic) is the practice of performing any of the various forms of worship in order to be seen and praised by people.  Doing religious acts to impress people destroys the spiritual benefits of righteous deeds and incurs sin on the person.  Sometimes, even the most pious are not spared of it because it is so hidden and the motivating force behind it is so ingrained.  Getting rid of it involves that one concentrate upon the fact that they are performing the worship for Allah’s pleasure alone, and not the pleasure of people.</p> <p>A Muslim must take great care to ensure intentions begin pure and remain pure whenever righteous deeds are being done.  In order to ensure this, the saying of Allah’s name is enjoined in Islam before all acts of importance.  A series of informal prayers (<i>du’as</i>) have also been prescribed by the Prophet before and after all natural habits to turn them into acts of worship and develop awareness of Allah.</p>",
        "text_4": "<h3>Astrology and Horoscopes</h3> <p>Predicting the future by means of comparing the positions of stars and constellations, in conjunction with the time of year that a person was born is a type of <i>shirk</i>.  Only Allah knows the future, so it is impossible to predict future events by studying the stars.  This is a form of <i>shirk</i> because belief in astrology credits astrologers with knowledge of the future, as well as the fact that they ascribe certain powers to  created objects – stars  – that neither Allah nor science has assigned.</p> <h3>Fortune-Telling</h3> <p>Reading palms, looking into a crystal ball, and other forms used to foretell the future are forms of <i>shirk</i> for the same reasons given above.</p> <h3>The Number 13</h3> <p>A common example of <i>shirk</i> is belief that the number thirteen is an unlucky number, especially in the West, where it is not uncommon for tall buildings not to have a thirteenth floor.  It is <i>shirk</i> because it assigns the ability to bring bad fortune to a mere number!</p> <h3>Lucky or Unlucky Creatures</h3> <p>It has been a common custom for certain animals or objects to be associated with good or bad luck for many centuries in many parts of the world.  For example, black cats, magpies, rabbits' feet, and horseshoes are thought to bring good luck.  All of these examples are <i>shirk</i> because the ability to bring good or bad luck is assigned to Allah’s creation.</p> <p>All Muslims should avoid all forms of <i>shirk</i>, and the only way one can be sure to do so is if they study its different forms and understand well the concept of <i>tawheed</i>. <i>Shirk</i> is the gravest of sins in Islam, more severe than other grave sins such as murder and adultery, for it vies with the sole right of Allah to worship. Thus, it is worthy that Muslims do their best to avoid <i>shirk</i> and become eligible to enter the Gardens of Paradise.</p>",

Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His messengers.  (They say,) ‘We make no distinction between one another of His messengers’” (Quran 2:285)</blockquote> <p>Allah conveys His message to humanity through messengers.  They form a link between the humans and the heavens, in the sense that Allah has chosen them to deliver His message to humanity.  Divine messages were not conveyed to mankind except through the messengers. It is the system of communication between the Creator and the created.  Allah does not send the angels to every single individual, nor does He ‘open the skies’ so people can climb up to receive the message.  His way of communication is through human messengers who receive the message through the angels. Allah only sent men as prophets and messengers. No angels were sent with a message to mankind. He, the Exalted, says:</p> <blockquote>‘And they say, “Why was there not sent down to him an angel? But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they would not be reprieved. And if We had made him [i.e. the Messenger] an angel, We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves.’ (6:8-9)</blockquote>",
        "text_2": "<p>Faith in messengers is to firmly believe Allah chose morally upright men to bear His message and pass it on to humanity.  Blessed were those who followed them, wretched were those who refused to obey.  They faithfully delivered the message, without hiding, altering, or corrupting it.  Rejecting a messenger is rejecting the One who sent him.  Disobeying a messenger is disobeying the One who commanded to obey him.</p> <p>Disbelieving in one messenger is like disbelieving in all the messengers. In the following verse, Allah, the Exalted, says that the people of Noah disbelieved in all the messengers, even though they were commanded only to follow Noah:</p> <blockquote>‘The people of Noah disbelieved in the messengers.’ (Quran 26:105)</blockquote> <p>More specifically, belief in messengers means:</p> <ol class='numbers'><li>Allah sent to every nation a prophet from amongst them, to call them to worship Allah alone and to shun false gods.</li> <blockquote>“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: ‘Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Merciful (that is Allah)?’” (Quran 43:45)</blockquote> <p>They did not add or omit anything from the Divine Message.</p> <blockquote>“Are the messengers charged with anything but to convey clearly the Message?” (Quran 16:35)</blockquote> <li>Belief in those have been specifically mentioned, such as Muhammad, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Noah, peace be upon them all.  We hold a general belief in those not mentioned by name as Allah says:</li> <blockquote>“And indeed, We have sent messengers before you (O Muhammad); of some of them We have related to you their story.  And of some We have not related to you their story” (Quran 40:78)</blockquote> <p>We believe the final messenger was our Prophet Muhammad and there is no prophet or messenger after him as Allah has said in the Quran:</p> <blockquote>“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.  And Allah is Ever All‑Aware of everything.” (Quran 33:40)</blockquote> <p>The Prophet stated categorically:</p> <p style='font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0%;'>“There will be no prophet after me.” (<i>Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim</i>)</p> <p>Previous prophets were sent with laws and commandments specific to that people in that time. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, however was sent with a message applicable for all time, people and places; thus, there is no need for more prophets to come. Another important reason is that some nations were sent more than one prophet due to the changes they introduced into the religion. Since God has promised that the teachings of Prophet Muhammad will never undergo change and will always be preserved in the original language in their primary sources – the Quran and <i>Sunnah</i>, there is no need for another prophet.  In the cases of earlier prophets, scriptures were lost or their message became corrupted to the point that truth was hardly distinguishable from falsehood.  The message of Prophet Muhammad is clear and preserved till the end of times.</p> <li>Belief in the sound reports that have been narrated from the messengers.  For instance, the teachings of Prophet Muhammad – the <i>Sunnah</i> - are preserved in the books of hadeeth.</li> <li>Following the laws of the messenger who has been sent to us, the final prophet Muhammad, who was sent to all of humanity.  Allah says:</li></ol> <blockquote>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission” (Quran 4:65)</blockquote>",

They were Allah’s worshipping slaves.  They ate, drank, slept, and lived normal human lives.  They did not have the power to make anyone accept their message or to forgive sins.

Allah guides human beings by revealing Divine Scriptures through which they realize the purpose of their creation.</li><li>By referring to it religious disputes and differences between its followers could be settled.</li> <li>The scriptures serve to keep the religion safe from corruption and deterioration at least for some time after the death of a prophet. However, the Quran revealed to our Prophet remains safe from corruption till the end of the time. Allah, the Exalted, says:</li> <blockquote>‘Indeed, it is We who sent down the message and indeed, We will be its guardian.’ (15:9)</blockquote> <li>In order that Allah’s conclusive argument brought by the messengers against human beings remains after their death.</li></ol> <blockquote>“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that humankind should have no plea against Allah after the messengers. And Allah is Ever All Powerful, All Wise.” (Quran 4:165)</blockquote> <p>No one can plea that the prophets and their messages are no longer in existence as long as the scriptures are present.</p>",
        "text_2": "<p>Belief in scriptures entails:</p> <ol class='custom-marker parens-around lower-roman'><li>Allah truly revealed them.</li> <li>Belief in the names of certain scriptures.</li> <li>Belief that they contain the truth. As for the scriptures prior to the Quran, since they have been changed, we believe in the <i>original</i> scriptures that were revealed to the prophets.</li> <li>Belief that the Quran is a witness over them and confirms them. The truth remains one and the same, and thus the Quran confirms the truth which was in them. As for the laws, the Quran has abrogated the previous scriptures.</li></ol> <p>First, a Muslim firmly believes that Divine Scriptures were revealed by Allah to His messengers to guide mankind.  Muslims believe the Quran is not the only spoken Word of Allah, but that Allah also spoke to prophets before Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.</p> <blockquote>“…and to Moses Allah spoke directly.” (Quran 4:164)</blockquote> <p>Allah describes true believers are those who:</p> <blockquote>“…believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad) and what has been sent down before you.” (Quran 2:4)</blockquote> <p>The most important and central message of all scriptures was to worship Allah alone.</p> <blockquote>“And we sent never a messenger before you except that we revealed to him, saying, ‘there is no God but I so worship Me.” (Quran 21:25)</blockquote> <p>Second, we believe in the scriptures mentioned in the Quran:</p><ol class='custom-marker parens-around lower-roman'><li>the Quran itself, revealed to Prophet Muhammad.</li> <li>the Torah (Taurah in Arabic) revealed to Prophet Moses (different from the Old Testament read today).</li> <li>the Gospel (Injeel in Arabic) revealed to Prophet Jesus (different from the New Testament read in churches today).</li> <li>the Psalms (Zabur in Arabic) of David.</li> <li>The scriptures (Suhuf in Arabic) of Moses and Abraham.</li></ol> <p>We have a general belief that there were other scriptures revealed by Allah whose names and specifics are not known to us. Thus we cannot definitely affirm that scriptures of other religions prior to Muhammad other than those mentioned were revealed from Allah.</p> <p>Third, Muslims believe whatever is true in them and has not been altered or corrupted in the previous scriptures.  This point will be elaborated below so it becomes clear and no confusion remains.</p> <p>Fourth, belief that Allah revealed the Quran as a witness over the previous scriptures and to confirm them, as Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and trustworthy in highness and a witness over it (old Scriptures)” (Quran 5:48)</blockquote> <p>Meaning the Quran confirms whatever is true in previous scriptures and rejects whatever alterations and changes human hands have made in them, and that the laws brought by the Quran overrule and abrogate any laws brought by the previous religions.</p>",
        "text_3": "<p>We must distinguish between two matters: the <i>original</i> Torah, Gospel, and Pslams and the present day Bible.  We believe the <i>originals</i> were Allah’s revelation, but the <i>present day</i> Bible does not have the exact original scripture.</p> <p>No scripture exists today in the original language it was revealed in, except the Quran.  The Bible was not revealed in English.  Different books of today’s Bible are translations of translations and different versions exist.  These multiple translations were done by people whose knowledge or honesty is not known.  As a result, some Bibles are bigger than others and have contradictions and internal inconsistencies!  No originals exist.  The Quran, on the other hand, is the only scripture in existence today in its original language and is internally consistent with no contradictions.  It is today as it was revealed 1400 years ago, transmitted by a rock-solid tradition of memorization and writing.  Few human being has ever memorized the whole Bible, not even any pope, whereas, the entire Quran is memorized by almost every Islamic scholar and hundreds of thousands of ordinary Muslims, generation after generation.  Now, that is preservation!</p> <p>The previous scriptures essentially consist of:</p> <ol class='custom-marker parens-around lower-roman'><li>stories of man’s creation and earlier nations, prophesies of what was to come like signs before the Judgment Day and new prophets, and other news.</li> <p>The stories, prophecies, and news in the Bible read in churches and synagogues today are partly true and partly false.  These books consist of some translated fragments of the original scripture revealed by Allah, words of some prophets, mixed with explanations of scholars, errors of scribes, and outright malicious insertions and deletions.  The Quran, the final and trustworthy scripture, helps us sort out fact from fiction.  It is the criterion to judge the truth from the falsehood in them.  For example, the Bible still contains some clear passages pointing to Allah’s oneness.[1]  Also, some prophecies regarding Prophet Muhammad are found in the Bible as well.  Yet, there are passages, even whole books almost entirely recognized to be forgeries and handiwork of men.</p> <li>Law and rulings, the allowed and prohibited, like the Law of Moses.</li> <p>If we were to <i>assume</i> the law, that is 'the lawful and the prohibited' contained in the previous books did not suffer corruption, the Quran still abrogates those rulings, it cancels the old law which was suitable for its time and is no longer applicable today.  For example, many old laws pertaining to diet, ritual prayer, fasting, inheritance, marriage and divorce have been abrogated by the Islamic Law, while others have remained the same.</p>",
        "text_4": "<p>The Quran is different from other scriptures in the following respects:</p> <ol class='numbers'><li>The Quran is miraculous and inimitable.  Nothing similar to it can be produced by human beings.</li> <li>After the Quran, no more scriptures will be revealed by Allah.  Just as Prophet Muhammad is the Last Prophet, the Quran is the Last Scripture.</li> <li>Allah has taken it upon Himself to protect the Quran from alteration, to safeguard it from corruption, and to preserve it from distortion.  On the other hand, previous scriptures suffered alteration and distortion and do not remain in their originally revealed form.</li> <li>The Quran, for one, confirms early scriptures and, for another, is a trustworthy witness over them.</li> <li>The Quran abrogates them, meaning it cancels many rulings of the previous scriptures and renders them inapplicable.  Thus the sum of Laws of the old scriptures is no longer applicable, the previous <i>rulings</i> having been abrogated or confirmed with what the Quran has brought.</li></ol>",

        "text_2": "<p>Angels are not ‘good forces of nature’, hologram images, or illusions.  Neither are angels like a fat cherubic baby with a halo on its head as often depicted in Christian illustrations.  They are real, created but are generally hidden from our senses.  They have no divine qualities and are not God’s associates running different districts of the universe.  Also, they are not objects to be worshipped or prayed to as they do not intercede for us at our request, nor do they deliver our prayers to God.  They all submit to God and carry out His commands.  There are no fallen angels; they are not divided into ‘good’ and ‘evil’ angels.  Human beings do not become angels after death.</p> <p>Angels were created from light before human beings.  The angels are beautiful beings with wings as described in the Quran.</p> <p>Angels form different hierarchies and orders in the sense they are of different size, status, and merit.  The best were those present at the battle of Badr who fought between the Prophet and the Meccan pagans.</p> <p>They are of great size.  The greatest of them is Gabriel.  Our Prophet actually saw him in his original form.  He had six hundred wings and blocked the horizon.  Jewels, pearls, and rubies fell from his wings, in a form only Allah knows about .  Also, the attendants of God’s Throne are among the greatest angels.  They love the believers and beseech Allah to forgive them their sins.  They carry the Throne of Allah, about whom the Prophet said:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“I have been given permission to speak about one of the angels of Allah that carry the Throne.  The distance between his ear-lobes and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.” (<i>Abu Daud</i>)</p> <p>They do not eat or drink.  When Abraham placed a calf in front of the visiting angels who brought him the good news of a son, they refused to eat:</p> <blockquote>“He said, ‘Will you not eat?’  (When they did not eat), he conceived a fear of them.  They said: ‘Fear not,’ and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.” (Quran 51:26-28)</blockquote> <p>The angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and worshipping Allah:</p> <blockquote>“They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.” (Quran 21:20)</blockquote>",
        "text_3": "<p>How many angels there are?  Only Allah knows.  <i>Al-Bayt al-Ma’moor</i>  is a sacred house in the heavens above the <i>Kabah</i>, the black cubical sacred house in Mecca.  Every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another group coming after them.</p> <p>The Messenger of Allah said:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold;'>“Hell will be brought forth that day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand angels.” (<i>Saheeh Muslim</i>)</p> <p>We are required to believe in the names of the angels that have been mentioned in the Quran and <i>Sunnah</i>.  They include:</p> <p>Gabriel (<i>Jibreel</i> in Arabic), Michael (<i>Mikaa’eel</i>), <i>Israfeel, Malik</i> - the gatekeeper of Hell, <i>Munkar</i> and <i>Nakeer</i>, and <i>Haarut</i> and <i>Maarut</i> and others.</p> <p>The names Raphael and Azra’eel are not furnished in Islamic texts.  Of the above, only Gabriel and Michael are mentioned in the Bible.</p>",
        "text_4": "<p>The angels have great powers given to them by Allah.</p> <p>They have the ability to take on different forms other than their own.  At the moment of Jesus’ conception, Allah sent Gabriel to Mary in the form of a man, as Allah says in the Quran:</p> <blockquote>“…Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.” (Quran 19:17)</blockquote> <p>Angels also came to Abraham in human form, and he did not know that they were angels until they told him so.  Similarly, angels came to Lot to deliver him from danger in the form of young men with beautiful faces.  Gabriel used to come to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, in different forms.  Sometimes he would appear in the form of one of his handsome disciples, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin.</p> <p>Angels have the ability to take human forms in some circumstances involving common people, such as the ones who came to the man who killed a hundred people and those who came to the blind, the bald and the leper.</p> <p>The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of light; the angels are able to travel much faster than this.  Hardly had an enquirer completed putting a question to the Prophet, but Gabriel would bring the answer from Allah.</p> <p>Gabriel is God’s messenger to mankind.  He would convey the revelation from Allah to His Messengers.  Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“Say, ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel – it is [none but] he who has brought the Qur’an down upon your heart, [O Muhammad], by permission of Allah, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.’” (Quran 2:97)</blockquote>",
        "text_5": "<p>Some angels are put in charge of executing God’s law in the physical world.  Michael is responsible for rain, directing it wherever Allah wishes.  He has helpers, who do what he tells them, by the command of his Lord; they direct the winds and clouds, as Allah wills.  Another is responsible for blowing the Trumpet, which will be blown by <i>Israafeel</i> at the onset of the Day of Judgment.  Others are responsible for taking souls out of the bodies at the time of death: these are the Angel of Death and his helpers.  Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“Say: ‘the Angel of Death put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls, then shall you be brought back to your Lord.’” (Quran 32:11)</blockquote> <p>Then there are personal guardian angels, responsible for protecting the believer throughout his life, when he stays home or travels, when he is asleep or awake.  These are the “angels in succession” concerning whom Allah says:</p> <blockquote>“For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him.  They guard him by the Command of Allah.” (Quran 13:10-11)</blockquote> <p>Others are responsible for recording the deeds of man, good and bad.  These are the “honorable scribes” (<i>kiraaman kaatibeen</i>).</p> <p><i>Munkar</i> and <i>Nakeer</i> are responsible for testing people in the grave.</p> <p>Among them are keepers of Paradise and the nineteen ‘guards’ of Hell whose leader is <i>‘Malik.’</i></p> <p>There are also angels responsible for breathing the soul into the fetus and writing down its provisions, life-span, actions, and whether it will be wretched or happy.</p> <p>Some angels are roamers, traveling around the world in search of gatherings where God is remembered.  There are also angels constituting God’s heavenly army, standing in rows, who never get tired or sit down, and others who bow or prostrate, and never raise their heads, always worshipping Allah.</p> <p>As we learn from above, the angels are a grandiose creation of God, varying in numbers, roles, and abilities. God is in no need of these creatures, but having knowledge and belief in them adds to the awe that one feels towards God, in that He is able to create as He wishes, for indeed the magnificence of His creation is a proof of the magnificence of the Creator.</p>"

        "text_3": "<p>After the duration of this earth is over, Allah will command a great angel named <i>Israfeel</i> to blow the Trumpet.

These balances will be real. God will give the deeds of His creatures a material existence with weight. Good deeds will be placed in one pan and the evil deeds will be placed in the other, as Allah has informed in the Qur’an.</p> <h3>The Records</h3> <p>Disclosure of the Records of the deeds performed in this life will follow. The person who will receive his record in his right hand will have an easy reckoning. He will happily go back to his family. However, the person who will receive his record in his left hand would wish he were dead as he will be thrown into the Fire. He will be full of regrets as will wish that he were not handed his Record or that he had not known it.</p> <p>Then Allah will judge His creation. They will be reminded and informed of their good and evil deeds. The faithful will acknowledge their sins and be forgiven. The disbelievers will have no good deeds to declare because an unbeliever is rewarded for his good deeds in this life. Some scholars are of the opinion that the punishment of an unbeliever may be reduced in lieu of his good deeds, except the punishment of the great sin of disbelief.</p> <h3>The Prophet’s Pond</h3> <p>Every prophet will have a pond, but the Pond of our Prophet will be the largest, sweetest, and with the largest number of visitors.

Anyone who is steadfast on God’s religion in this life will find it easy to pass it. It will be thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword! People will pass over it as fast as the blinking of an eye, lightening, wind, fast moving horses, running camels, or at a normal walking pace. Some will barely crawl over it. They will be grabbed by iron hooks and thrust into the Fire. The one who crosses the Siraat will get into Paradise.</p> <p>Those who cross it will be assembled at a place between Paradise and Hell. They will get their mutual debts settled and then allowed to enter Paradise.</p>",

The divine decree (<i>Qadr</i>) is an extremely important article of faith, and people of various faiths have differed among themselves concerning this issue for a long time.</p> <p>The divine decree is Allah’s ‘hidden mystery’ whose depths are inaccessible for human beings to fathom.  A Muslim should learn the correct belief regarding the divine decree and stick to the advice of the Prophet:</p> <p style='text-indent: 0%; font-weight: bold'>“When the divine decree (<i>Qadr</i>) is mentioned, take to silence.” (<i>Saheeh Muslim</i>)</p> <p>At the same time, we have been given enough information about this subject in order for us to be at peace with it, even if we may not know its intricacies. For this reason, it is a compulsory aspect of faith, and emphasizing the importance of this belief, Ibn Umar, the famous Companion of Prophet Muhammad, once swore and said of those who rejected it, ‘If one of them were to spend gold equal to Mount Uhad in the way of Allah, it will never be accepted by Allah from them, unless they believe in the divine decree.’</p> <p>What is this faith in the divine decree (<i>Qadr</i>) and what exactly does one have to believe in?</p> <ol class='numbers'><li>Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive and complete.</li> <li>Allah has recorded everything in the Preserved Tablet.</li> <li>Allah’s Will always comes to pass, and His Ability is perfect.</li> <li> Allah created everything.</li></ol>",
        "text_2": "<p>The first necessary component is to believe in Allah’s infallible foreknowledge.  Allah knows what the creatures will do, encompassing everything by His knowledge.  He knows all that exists, in entirety and totality, by virtue of His ancient and eternal foreknowledge.  It is the same to Him whether it is related to His Actions or the acts of His slaves.  He knows their state, obedience and disobedience, sustenance, life span, successes and failures, and all their movements.  Before He created them, and even before He created the heavens and the earth, Allah knew exactly who will enter Paradise and who will abide in Hell.</p> <blockquote>“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heavens.” (Quran 3:5)</blockquote> <blockquote>“Do you not know that Allah knows all that occurs in heaven and on earth?” (Quran 22:70)</blockquote> <p>Whoever refuses it denies Allah’s perfection, because the opposite of knowledge is either ignorance or forgetfulness.  It would mean Allah would have been mistaken in His foreknowledge of future events; He would no longer be Omniscient.  Both are deficiencies which Allah is free of.  When Pharaoh asked Moses:</p> <blockquote>“(Pharaoh said:) ‘What about the generations of old?’ <br>(Moses) said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Record.  My Lord is neither unaware nor He forgets’” (Quran 20:51, 52)</blockquote> <p>Allah is not unaware of the future, nor does He forget anything from the past.</p>",
        "text_3": "<p>The second necessary component is that Allah has recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Judgment in <i>Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz</i> (the Preserved Tablet).  The life spans of all human beings are written and the amount of their sustenance apportioned.  Eternal selection and condemnation were written for all humanity before they were created.  Of their own will they went out; of their own will they fell, and because their fall was foreknown, so it was written.</p> <p>Everything that is created or occurs in the universe is according to what is recorded there.  Allah has said:</p> <blockquote>“Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record.  Indeed that, for Allah, is easy.” (Quran 22:70)</blockquote> <p>Sometimes the sinful attempt to justify sin by saying, “I committed this sin because it was written.”  The mistake is in his thinking that the mere writing takes away his free will and implies he had no choice in his actions!  The answer to such a person is, “No.  Since you did it, therefore it was written.”  Meaning he was free to choose.  What was written was simply the choice that he would take, made known to Allah by His foreknowledge without denying his free will.</p>",
        "text_4": "<p>Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, and whatever Allah does not will does not happen.  Nothing occurs in the heavens or on the earth without the Will of Allah.  Hence, whatever is in the universe occurs by the Will of Allah, be it a divine act or actions of the creation:</p> <blockquote>“Had He so willed, he would indeed have guided you all.” (Quran 6:149)</blockquote> <p>If we were to say that something occurs in existence without Allah willing it, that would mean that things can occur without the Will of Allah, and that would be a shortcoming in Allah’s power and will. Rather, everything that occurs can only be if Allah wills it. If He did not will it to occur, it could have never come into being.</p> <p>Likewise the actions of the creation occur by the Will of Allah:</p> <blockquote>“And you do not will except that Allah wills – Lord of the worlds.” (Quran 81:29)</blockquote> <p>No one can do anything except if Allah wills it to be, had He willed that they do not take place, they would not have occurred.</p>",
        "text_5": "<blockquote>“He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its own measurement.” <br>“For it is He who creates everything and determines its nature in accordance with (His own) design.” (Quran 25:2)</blockquote> <p>This includes our characteristics and our deeds.</p> <p>The human beings are created by Allah and so are the actions and statements that result from them.  This is because the actions and the statements of a person are his characteristics; if the person is a creation, then so are his characteristics a creation of Allah.</p> <blockquote>“While Allah has created you and what you do.” (Quran 37:96)</blockquote> <p>We are given the physical ability and a choice.  Our abilities like intelligence and memory differ just like our characteristics like height, weight, and color.  Also, we are given a will and have a choice.</p> <p>If one of them does not exist, the act would not be performed.  The One who has created the choice and the ability is Allah, the Creator of the cause and the effect.  Since Allah has created both, the ability and the choice in us, hence the acts that we perform are also created by Allah.</p>"
